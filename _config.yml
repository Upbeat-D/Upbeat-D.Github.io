  Hi, my name's Chengcheng Dai and I am a graduate at Geology department at NWU. I recently finished my Undergraduate thesis with Prof Gang Chen at NWU. My research interest is evaluating global vegetation-climate feedbacks, such as carbon, water, and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere, using a fusion of remote sensing techniques, specifically in regions with limited direct measurements, including the Arctic and mountainous regions.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Geochemistry(SIF)</mark>, <mark>canopy reflectance</mark>, and <mark>Igneous Rocks</mark>
