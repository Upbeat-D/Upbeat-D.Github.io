  Hi, my name's Chengcheng Dai and I am a graduate at Geology department at Northwest University(NWU, <em>Xi'an<em>, <em>People's Republic of China<em>). My research is based on the field investigation, petrographic observation and geochemical study utilizing integrated tracer of elements and isotopes (e.g.,Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf and Mg, Fe, Zn) of mantle-derived volcanic rocks, aiming to study: (1) the chemical composition and evolution of mantle, (2) the melting process occurred in mantle, and (3) the evolution of magma at different depth.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Mantle Geochemistry</mark>, <mark>LATEX</mark>, and <mark>Igneous Petrology</mark>

          <em> For the first time, bibliometrics was used to study the changes in the number of publications of 15 stable isotope systems from 2000 to 2021, and data visualization was used to analyze the status of international cooperation in the field of non-traditional stable isotopes, and the current status of international and Chinese research. From bibliometrics perspectives provide new insights into the development of this field.  </em>

      Alongside my research interests, my other interests and hobbies are:

      - **Photograpy**

      - **Hiking**

      - **Reading**

      Look at this cool image I took in Xi'an.
