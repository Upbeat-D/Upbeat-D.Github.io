The views of Bryce Canyon in winter are breathtaking. This national park is not really a canyon, but is famous for its numerous giant amphitheaters. Among the many national parks in Utah, Bryce Canyon is unique. I haven't seen Bryce Canyon in the summer time, so I will revisit.

Most of the trails were closed in winter, and the ranger warned us not to hike down the valley or we would break legs. However, we decided to give it a try, and it turned out to be a good decision.
