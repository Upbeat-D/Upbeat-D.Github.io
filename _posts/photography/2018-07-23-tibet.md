In this past summer, I joined a field trip in southern Tibet, one of my not-so-many long serious field trips. The field trip was led by Dr. Weiqiang Ji from CAS. We had a total of eight people on our team, including six geologists and two local drivers. It was my first time to be in Tibet. 7/6-7/22.

Tibet is special to geologists, nature enthusiasts, or everyone perhaps. It is the largest mountain belt/plateau in the world. Tibet is home to numerous high mountains, including Mt. Everest, the highest peak in the world. It is the roof of the planet. Tibet is unique its landscapes, climate, ecosystems, people and culture. Tibet is high and lonely. It is far less accessible than other mountainous areas, and remains as one of the least known places in the world. Tibet is an extreme land.

Tibet started to rise somewhat 50-70 million years ago, and is still rising today. The rise of Tibet is due much to the collision between India and Asia. Tibet is a facinating place to study geology. It's a complicated dynamic system and just about everyone in Earth sciences can find something to his/her taste in Tibet. We landed in Lhasa on 7/6, took a break on 7/7 and started off our journey on 7/8. The altitude effect was always there, but I got used to it after a couple of days. My fitbit Alta HR recorded a gradual increase of my resting heart rate from < 60 to 75 in the first week. I knew my body was adapting to the low oxygen.

Farms of highland barley (青稞). Rice and wheat do not grow well in Tibet due to the lack of water. Highland barley instead is the staple food here.

The rain is coming. Summer is the wet season in Tibet, and we had quite a lot of raining days during the trip.
