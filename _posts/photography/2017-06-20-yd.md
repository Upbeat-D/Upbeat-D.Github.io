While I was visiting my parents in China this year, mom and I went to Yandang Mountain Geological Park for vacation. Yandang is located in Zhejiang Province, China, and is about, by train, 5 hours away from my hometown Zhenjiang. We spent three days there. It was rainy but not too bad. 

Visiting Yandang was more or less a random idea when I searched for interesting places nearby. Dad was too busy, so I planned to take mom out for a vacation every year. Last year we climbed the Huang Mountain, which was too exhausting for my mom who was over 50. I had been hoping the Yandang mountain would be more relaxing, and it was. Most places were accessible by bus in the park plus a bit of hiking and climbing.

The Yandang mountain is a volcano in the Mesozoic volcanic zone in eastern China. Massive rhyolitic magma erupted somewhat 120 million years ago and formed the mountains.
