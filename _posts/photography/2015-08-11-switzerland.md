Switzerland was our first stop in 2015 trip to Europe. We spent three days backpacking in the Alps, one day in Interlaken and Zurich each. Although there were no technical challenges in our hiking plan, it was quite exhausting, especially the first day when we hiked 20 miles in the mountains. We came back to lodge almost at midnight, but it was totally worth it.

Mt. Matterhorn in the cloud. Matterhorn is a symbol of Alps. It's only 4478m high, not much different from Mt. Whitney which we summited in 2014, but is the sixth most dangerous mountain in the world.

Matterhorn in dusk. It was 9 pm, and we were still 7 miles away from lodge. We used an offline map to find our way back. Saw nobody in the mountain.

Lake Brienz. Had a break in Interlaken, a nice small city between two lakes. The water was crystal clear, sourced from glacier ice. Actually the water was so clean that not many fishes could survive.
