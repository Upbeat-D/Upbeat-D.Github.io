Before and after our road trip in Washington, we made a few short trips in the bay area of California. We drove to the Half Moon Bay to see tide pool, Land Ends and revisited Point Reyes National Seashore. There are a lot of scenic spots along the coast of California that can be explored in 1/2 to a full day. Xin and I are just not early birds, and we usually start our trips after brunch, drive there, hike a bit and come back after sunset.

In tide pools, there are crabs, sea anemones, fish, shrimps, and sometimes even octopus. A dad was helping his kids to cross a tide pool.

People playing on the beach at Point Reyes. That afternoon we drove 2 hours to get there, stayed for one hour or so and spent another 2 hours to drive back. Crazy...
