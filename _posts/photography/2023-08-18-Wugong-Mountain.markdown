I had always longed for mountains and wilderness, so I took the train to Changsha with an unseating ticket, where I would transfer to Pingxiang 15 hours later and start my first trek in my life. Along the way, people chatted, played cards, and quarreled. I didn't sleep well. But when I set foot on the land of Pingxiang,  I was greeted by the sight of a blue sky, lush vegetation, and the aroma of paddy fields filling my lungs. My fatigue and exhaustion quickly dissipated.

The trail leading up the mountain from Longfashanzhuang takes through dense forests. Crystal-clear water flows in the mountain stream, and the bamboo forest at the mountain's base resounds with the song of cicadas. The guidance streamers flutter in the breeze, and the supply station along the way exudes its own unique charm. As I emerged from the thick forest, the setting sun cast a warm hue over the mountains, and the meadows swayed gently in the evening breeze. The only sounds that filled my ears were the rustling of grass and leaves, offering me the long-lost sense of peace and tranquility. Finding a flat spot, I pitched my tent, boiled a pot of instant noodles, and gazed up at the starry sky. This was a procedure I had mentally rehearsed several times, and I executed it step by step.

No matter how tired you were the day before, or how poorly you slept the previous night, you always anticipate the moment you unzip the tent the next morning. This is the charm of trekking. As I opened the outer tent, a refreshing mountain breeze rushed into my coat, instantly awakening me. The lush green grass covering the hills and plains emitted its distinct fragrance, while a sea of orange-red clouds swirled in the distance, and the sun gradually ascended. The sky was clear, the air crisp, and the gentle breeze caressed my skin.

I packed up my things and continued my journey. The next section led me to the heart of Wugong Mountainâ€”the alpine meadow. My anticipation was palpable. The trail meandered through the stunning and unbroken landscape of Wugong Mountain. From time to time, I came across peculiar rock formations and thriving larch trees, with unknown wildflowers scattered in between. The afternoon brought a change in the sky, presenting Wugong Mountain in a different light from the clear morning. I kept walking, conquering one peak after another and encountering fellow trekkers of various ages and backgrounds. Conversations and words of encouragement along the way made the journey seem less arduous. Finally, I reached the Golden Summit. I opted to take the ropeway down the mountain. The Buddhist temple at the mountain's base exuded simplicity and tranquility, providing a peaceful place for me to rest.

I had expected to be overwhelmed with emotions when I reached the summit, but it didn't happen. Three or four days later, as I sorted through the photos, the feelings I had experienced at that moment had nearly faded. However, the tumultuous emotions I had before the trip seemed to have gained a touch of serenity.

On my return journey, I made a stop in Changsha. Wearing my hiking gear, I explored the Changsha IFS, searched for delicious rice noodles in the quaint alleys, embarked on a nighttime ascent of Yuelu Mountain, shared drinks with strangers at a youth hostel, observed elderly folks fishing along the banks of the Xiangjiang River, and zipped around on an electric car to catch the high-speed train.
