We only spent two days in Germany as we traveled from Switzerland to Czech Republic. We stopped for two places in Germany, F端ssen and Munich. F端ssen is a small town, and is famous for the nearby Neuschwanstein Castle. Neuschwanstein is not a Medieval castle, but is a Romanesque Revival palace built in the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, because the best lookout point was under construction, views of the castle were limited. The castle tour was worth going for. They offered audio guide during the tour.

I will definetely go back to revisit this fairy tale place.

Countryside in southern Germany. This picture was taken when we were traveling to F端ssen by train, which was comfortable and quiet. I felt greately relaxed after backpacking for five days.

View of Neuschwanstein Castle from my Airbnb place. Unlike other castles, Neuschwanstein Castle was not built for defense purposes, but as a fanciful retreat for Ludwig II of Bavaria. Every single room in Neuschwanstein was adorned by breathtaking paintings. Photos were not allowed inside the castle.

Behind Neuschwanstein Castle. The iron bridge was the best lookout for the castle.

Man reading by fountain, Munich. This looks like an HDR processed photo, but it's not. The light was funky.
