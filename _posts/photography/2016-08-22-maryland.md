On Aug. 22nd, 2016, I left Maryland. 

Five years, from 8/2011 to 8/2016, was short indeed, but full of memories. Here, I learnt, worked, played, lived, and grew up. This collection includes pictures taken in Maryland and the D.C. area. This collection is mixed of film and digital photos. I was an enthusiast about film photography in the early days, and shot, developed and scanned films all by myself. A few years later I had to give up as shooting films became too expensive for a graduate student like me.

This is one of the first film photos I took here. I was so crazy about shooting films that I bought most of the Contax G series lenses. I can easily tell this one was shot with a Contax Zeiss G35 lens. Shooting films is completely different from shooting digital. You never know what you get until you develop the films, print them out or scan them. Lots of surprise when I saw the results. Pretty damn good!

There was a bike shop on campus where student volunteers provided free service. I am very grateful for that because I had riden a bike for almost three years before I finally bought a car. A volunteer was adjusting my new bike.

Lake Artemesia in fall. I like walking by Lake Artemesia. It was small but beautiful, and changed from season to season.
