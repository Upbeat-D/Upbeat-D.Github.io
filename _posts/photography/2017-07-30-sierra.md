The Sierra Nevada, located in central California, is a mountain range that primarily formed in the last two hundred million years when the Pacific ocean floor subducted beneath the North America continent. The Sierra Nevada mountain range is commonly seen in geoscience literature. In the past week, I had a chance to see it myself. Our week-long field trip was led by Scott Paterson, a structure geologist from the University of Southern California. This trip was about granitic plutons and arc evolution. A Chinese geology group joined our field trip, and I was their driver. The Chinese group was led by Drs. Fuyuan Wu and Jinhui Yang. Dr. Wu is a member of Chinese Academy of Science, a humble person with a great mind. It was an honor and fun to talk with Dr. Wu during the trip.

This was my first serious field trip since I came to the US. It's a regret that I didn't have chances to work in the field during my Ph.D. All my samples came in chips, powder or mounts. Although I traveled a lot and visited many national parks, those experiences are different. In the field, I learn and think as a real geologist.

Snow was melting. The river, fed by melted snow, became a problem for many of us. Xu fell over and dislocated his arm when crossing the turbulent cold water.

Overview of the valley. I was wearing the wrong shoes, which became completely wet when hiking through the muddy swamps. After we returned at the end of the day, I dashed to a nearby outdoor shop and bought a pair of waterproof hiking shoes.

Much of the mountain was capped in snow due to unusually heavy precipitation in the past winter and spring.
