<!-- adding {:#DropCap} above will make first letter of first word CAPITAL and Large -->Since this century, the booming development of non-traditional stable isotopes has become one of the most striking advances in geochemistry. Various isotope systems have been successively developed and applied in fields such as solid earth science, planetary geochemistry, and low-temperature geological processes, and have made remarkable progress.

This project was suggested by one of my advisors, Li-Hui Chen. We reconstruct the progress of the non-traditional stable isotopes through bibliometrics. A total of 4111 relevant documents were included in the statistics.

**Fig. 2**. Number of papers in the field of non-traditional stable isotopes by different countries. Switzerland dropped out of the top five, and the proportions of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France were basically stable. The share of the United States continues to decline, and China catches up from behind.

**Fig. 4**. The number of papers and co-occurrence density in different countries. The size of the circle represents the number of papers, and the thickness of the line represents the closeness of the relationship.

**Fig. 5**. Since the proportions of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have remained basically unchanged in several stages, while the proportions of the United States and China have changed greatly, we compare them in groups. Also analyze the ratio of the number of NI papers to the total number of papers.

**Fig. 6**. The top ten international institutions and Chinese institutions with the highest number of papers also show the proportion of NI papers to all papers.
